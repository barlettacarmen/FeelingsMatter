#README
This project involves the use of biosensors and virtual reality to build a system for therapists of people with NDD disabilities.
It aims to provide realtime information about the emotions of the patient while he is watching a 360 degree video (retrieved by the YouTube library) on a smarthpone application.
The video can be controlled by the therapist (play/pause/change video) who can also define some "bounderies" for the emotions' values, such that when one of them exceeds these boundaries the therapist will receive a visual notification.
It will be also possible to consult a final report about the experience.
